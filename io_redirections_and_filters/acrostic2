For the time we spent together
On that crimson wooden poarch
Red the files of our best commands
Every time with you by my side
Voted for unlimited time
Elders gathering around our souls
Riding they ghostly mounts
In the purpose of love
Now and forever
Yell at the crowd
Others will cry
Users will log in the shell
Rolling around trees
Every trim
Yolo
Espagnol
Sauce
